# RSAyyyy [Reverse 358 points]

### Chall's description
```
This challenge is designed to give an overview
of the RSA algorithm. If you have a team member
that is less familiar with RSA that wants to be,
give this challenge to them. This might be useful.

## Solution
This is a "educational" chall; we enjoyed to do it to `refresh` our RSA knowledge.
There are multiple tasks that help you to understand how RSA works (with some math's help)


### Level 1: Calculating
```bash
p = 2800941491
q = 4071798539
What is n?
```

#### Answer
```bash
11404869470878281649
```
#### Explanation
From the formula n = p*q


### Level 2: Calculating m

```bash
message = "hover exculpatory broadminded Bromley constructible"
What is m?
```

#### Answer
```
269678299779785121551311846594485190570778179799456098570707555275403511188378404406315707027746721729831218463132835015781

Congratulations! You beat Level 2!

Now, we are going to actually calculate ciphertext.
```

#### Explanation(Code)
```python
message = "hover exculpatory broadminded Bromley constructible"

''.join([hex(ord(x))[2:] for x in message])             # <--- hex value
int(''.join([hex(ord(x))[2:] for x in message]),16)     # <--- int value
```

### Level 3: Calculating c
```bash 
p = 2871875029
q = 3482439599
What is n?
#1              <===

Ayyyyy

e = 65537
m = 7089056601674313572
What is c?
#2              <===

Ayyyyy

Congratulations! You beat Level 3!

In order for RSA to be asymmetrical,
the private exponent, d, needs to be calculated.
```

#### Answer and Explanation
```
#1
For the formula n = p*q
n = 2871875029 * 3482439599
  = 10001131324368873371

#2
m^e mod(n) = (7089056601674313572 ** 65537) % 10001131324368873371
           = 8733466864177587635
```



### Level 4: Calculating d
```bash
p = 3361037497
q = 3507131801
What is tot(n)?
#1              <===

Whoop whoop!

e = 65537
What is d?
#2              <===

Nice job!

Congratulations! You beat Level 4!

The easiest way to break RSA is factoring n, if it is possible.
```

#### Answer and Explanation
```
#1
For the formula tot(n) = (p-1) * (q-1)
tot(n) = (3361037497-1)*(3507131801-1) = 11787601483213972800

#2
e = 65537
tot(n) = 11787601483213972800
mulinv(e, tot(n)) = 1841065181228591873
```

#### Code from [Wikibooks](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Algorithm_Implementation/Mathematics/Extended_Euclidean_algorithm)
```python
def xgcd(b, a):
    x0, x1, y0, y1 = 1, 0, 0, 1
    while a != 0:
        q, b, a = b // a, a, b % a
        x0, x1 = x1, x0 - q * x1
        y0, y1 = y1, y0 - q * y1
    return  b, x0, y0

# x = mulinv(b) mod n, (x * b) % n == 1
def mulinv(b, n):
    g, x, _ = xgcd(b, n)
    if g == 1:
        return x % n

print(mulinv(65537, 11787601483213972800))
```

### Level 5: Factoring n
```bash
n = 9613631774438905337
What is p?
```

#### Answer
```
3536763563

Ayyyyy

Congratulations! You beat Level 5!

Now, let's put everything together and break RSA!
```


#### Explanation
```
[[[on Wolframalpha]]]
factor 9613631774438905337

Result:
2718200299 x 3536763563 (2 distinct prime factors)

-> 9613631774438905337 / 2718200299 = 3536763563

I think you could use the other number as the answer but I didn't test it.
```

### Level 6: Breaking simple RSA
```bash
c = 1940747889140053401
n = 11191414813257978223
e = 65537
What is p?
#1              <===

That was adequate.

What is q?
#2              <===

Way to go!

What is tot(n)?
#3              <===

Whoop whoop!

What is d?
#4              <===

Ayyyyy

Finally, what is m?
#5              <===

Nice job!

Congratulations! You beat Level 6!


Congratulations on finishing this introduction to RSA!
I hope this was fun and informative.

Here's your flag:
TUCTF{RSA_1$_R34LLY_C00L_4ND_1MP0RT4NT_CRYPT0}
```

#### Code and Tools

##### Answer and Explanation
```bash
#1
2749593919 (see below how we catch this result)

#2
From the formula n = p*q -> q = n/p
q = int(11191414813257978223/2749593919) = 4070206417

#3
From the formula tot(n) = (p-1) * (q-1)
tot(n) = (2749593919-1) * (4070206417-1) = 11191414806438177888

#4
e = 65537
tot(n) = 11191414806438177888
d = mulinv(e, tot(n)) = 9196881566601171041 (we reused the solution #5)

#5
[[[on Wolframalpha]]]
(1940747889140053401^9196881566601171041) mod 11191414813257978223
Result: 8244229906027274615
```
